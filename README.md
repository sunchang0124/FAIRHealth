# FAIRHealth

This repository contains two simulated datesets and one Python code (jupyter notebook) which converts CSV file to R2RML file. They are applied to test our privacy-preserving infrastructure (based on personal health train architecture) in a simulated scenario. More information you can find about:

## Simulated dataset
This simulated dataset is from a publicly available simulated dataset which contains variables that could be interpreted as sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and reimbursement information of patients [https://edu.kpfu.ru/pluginfile.php/278552/mod_resource/content/1/MachineLearningR__Brett_Lantz.pdf]. Additionally, we generated artificial personal identifiers including date of birth, zipcode, house number, and sex for record linkage by using a Python tool called Faker [https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/]. 

First, this dataset is vertically split over two providers: 
Provider A has personal identifiers, BMI, number of children, and smoking status; 
Provider B has the same personal identifiable information and living region, and reimbursement information. 

Second, we simulated that Provider A only hosts a small number of patients, i.e., 1338 patients, while Provider B hosts about 400,000 patients (which includes Provider Aâ€™s patients too).
